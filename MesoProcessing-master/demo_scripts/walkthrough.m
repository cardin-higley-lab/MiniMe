% lets look at the mean signal over time
% we sample at 10 Hz, so to create time vector we divide 1:number of frames
% by 10 to convert frame number to seconds. We divide the variable
% numFrames by 2, because it is the total number of frames, ie uv and
% calcium. Half of them should be calcium. Could also call the function
% size on blue_raw to get the number of frames. 

% also note that unlike before, the size of the variable is number of
% pixels by number of frames. In otherwords, it is 2D rather than 3D. We
% collapsed all the pixels into 1 dimension because it is easier to do some
% operations. To get it back to 3D, we can call
% reshape(variableName,256,256,[]) to get a 3D variable. The [] tells the
% funtion to fill in the missing spot itself, and will throw an error if
% the number of elements is changed (because that wouldnt make sense, can
% explain this further)

title('Mean Raw Sig Over Time')
%% detrending
% in this step we do a high pass filter, which means we first transform our
% signal to the frequency domain and then keep the signal that is higher
% than a specificed frequency (this includes 0 Hz signals, ie constant
% offsets). This removes (probably) non-biological slow changes in
% our signal 

blue_raw=reshape(blue_raw, R*C, []);
uv_raw=reshape(uv_raw, R*C, []);
[det_blue,baseline_blue] = detrend_pixels(blue_raw, params.deterend);
[det_uv,baseline_uv] = detrend_pixels(uv_raw, params.deterend);


% lets look at the mean detrended signal over time

plot((1:numFrames/2-params.deterend.filtLen)/10,nanmean(det_blue(:,params.deterend.filtLen/2:end-params.deterend.filtLen/2-1),1))
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Mean');
title('Mean detrended Sig Over Time')


% If you have enough frames, you should see the signal decay to and
% oscillate around 0


%% zscore pixelwise
% One thing to keep in mind about zscoring (or any form of normalization
% really) is that you lose information on magnitude. Here, we are going to
% zscore each pixel in time. This means if pixel 1 has variance of 3 while
% pixel 2 has a variance of 1000, you could never tell when you go to watch
% the zscored movie. But it seems to help the hemodynamic correction, so we
% do it and then save the mean and std of each pixel


[dff_blue, mval_blue, sval_blue] = zscore_pixelwise(det_blue, params.deterend.filtLen);
[dff_uv, mval_uv, sval_uv] = zscore_pixelwise(det_uv, params.deterend.filtLen);


%% Remove Hemodynamics

% here with both the uv and calcium data we use a path_size by patch_size
% grid around each pixel in the calcium data to predict its value. 
% This seems to do a good job at predicting the hemodynamic artifacts.


patch_size = 9;% set this size according to the amount of time samples you have.

% here we load the allen brain atlas and use it to mask out non brain areas
% of our images (dont want the factor them in this computation since they
% have nothing to do with neural activity). Jess likes to block out the
% midline but it seems like we don't have to do that anymore with our new
% hemodynamic technique. 

load('parcells_updated121519.mat','parcells_new');
brain_mask = parcells_new.CombinedParcells>0;


% need to mask the our data (only take some of the values)so flatten our 2D
% mask to match our the shape of our data
flat_mask = reshape(brain_mask,1,[]);
 

% this function does the hemodynamic correction. Have to mask our data
% before passing it (It is silly but I didnt make this function okay)
[std_blue, std_uv, dff_final]  = regress_filter_3d(...
    dff_blue, ...
    dff_uv, ...
    brain_mask, patch_size, 1:R*C);


% lets see the fruits of our labor
% we will need to adjust the colormap to see anything.
% in the tools drop down menu go to colormap, select parula, check the box
% to specify a range, make the mimum something like -0.01 and maximum
% something like 0.01. Can play with other values. Press apply and close
% the box to view. 
implay(reshape(dff_final,256,256,[]),10);

%% parcellation
% here we parcellate the data by the Allen brain atlas.
dFoF_parcels = parcels_by_Allen_atlas(dff_final);

% the result should be something like 56 by the number of frames. Plot the
% parcel values like we did for the mean value (but dont take mean this
% time!). To see what each parcel is, checkout the parcells_new.description
% field. Plot the ones that have the coolest names.

% Great! Next we can work on aligning it to behavioral data.
